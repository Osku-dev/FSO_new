# Full Stack Open Course Code

This repository contains the code I’m developing for the **Full Stack Open** course, which offers a comprehensive introduction to modern web development using JavaScript, React, Node.js, and related technologies.

### Related Repositories:
- [**React2 Repository**](https://github.com/Osku-dev/react2): Contains similar code from the same course, which I started two years ago before transitioning into a full-time software engineering role. Although I paused my progress on that repository, I’ve now resumed the course and am actively working on completing it.

- [**Part3-Persons-Backend Repository**](https://github.com/Osku-dev/part3-persons-backend): This repository includes backend code that also relates to the Full Stack Open course.

Thank you for visiting! Feel free to explore the code, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
